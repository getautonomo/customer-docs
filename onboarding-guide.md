# ðŸŽ“ Onboarding Guide

## :wave: Greetings Call

Once you've paid your invoice, we'll need a couple business days or so to get your portal set up for you. It'll be worth the wait, we'll complete as much as we can from **Step 1** and **Step 2** for you!If you want to dig in now, I recommend documenting any changes you want to make to your Service offering and Pricing **now**. That will help speed up **Step 1**.Before we start setup, let's get on a call. No prep is generally needed unless your onboarder states otherwise.

## :moneybag: Step 1: Booking + Pricing

**Step 1** is all about getting your booking and pricing set up. These reflect your revenue stream and are the foundation for all the other features on Tonomo. During account setup, we added some of your Services and Packages for you. So for **Step 1** we just want to look over that work, answer any questions and make any required changes.In addition, we're going to complete one technical item.

### **Goals** <a href="#goals" id="goals"></a>

Haven't planned out your Services and Packages clearly yet? We put together a worksheet to help organize your offerings. [Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2vVPqlPNtxyQdpajiHt6XDEUmo7qkhB9Gr-7tdsK-0/edit?usp=sharing) to access it, log into your Google Account and then click **File** > **Make Copy** in the top left corner. If you don't have Google, copy/paste to Excel. The first spreadsheet is an **example** and the second is a **worksheet** for you to fill.

### **Goals** <a href="#goals" id="goals"></a>

* Walkthrough a complete order from booking to delivery using fake customer information.
* Discover all of the tweaks and changes we want to make in the portal
* Decide on a go live strategy:
  * Go live to all customers at the same time
  * Rollout to select customers first for feedback
  * Run staff through system first for feedback
* Confirm all staff are within Tonomo and you've set their [schedules/availability](https://docs.getautonomo.com/scheduling/scheduling-configuration/photographer-availability)

## Go Live

Before you go live to your customers there are a couple of things we recommend double checking:

1. 1.Your Booking Flow settings, particularly [deposit/payment rules](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MUkebiCddgbNFLjTeWM/services-and-packages/booking-flows#payment-settings) and what [Services ](https://docs.getautonomo.com/services-and-packages/booking-flows#services)you offer.
2. 2.Your [User's calendars](https://docs.getautonomo.com/Users/add-and-configure-your-users#adding-your-staff) are connected and their [availability](https://docs.getautonomo.com/scheduling/scheduling-configuration/photographer-availability) is set. (You will know their calendar is set if it appears in the **Schedule** section).

This will ensure that customers can book normally.
