# Packages

{% hint style="info" %}
You cannot complete Packages without setting up [Services](services.md). Complete the Services section before continuing here.

Packages are a sales and marketing tool for you to bundle standard Services together into a grouping, typically with a price break. This also improves the booking process by enabling your Agents to check out in a few clicks.

A common technique is to offer "Essentials," "Plus," and "Premier" packages, providing a clear upsell path for more premium services an Agent wouldn't typically consider. Here is one example of what that might look like:

Setting up Packages is easy because your Services are all ready to go. Start by navigating to **Configure Booking** and **Packages**.

## Creating Packages

To create a Package, click **+ Add Package** in the top right corner.&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/3 + Add Package.png>)

This will take you to a new window with quite a few options. Let's break that down.

### General Information

This first section should look familiar to Services. You need to select a thumbnail, name, description, and price. On the second photo below is a visual representation of your listing when you enter the below information.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/package preview.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Package Preview</p></figcaption></figure>

The size of the Package thumbnails is 600x230. Our recommended resolution is 1280x540.

The **Price** field is a "default" price all Agents will see if you aren't using [Dynamic Pricing](displaying-your-pricing.md#dynamic-pricing). If you are using Dynamic Pricing, the price displayed to the customer will be different than what you enter here because we'll customize the price depending on the size of the project.

Enable the **Send Two Photographers** feature to assign two photographers per package when needed. This is especially useful for long or complex shoots that might be too much for one photographer. You can customize which shoots require two photographers and which don’t.

Choose the **package type** that best fits your needs. Selecting the right package type ensures accurate pricing and a smoother booking process:

* **Property** – Ideal for real estate listings, this works with **sq ft pricing** using **Dynamic Pricing**.
* **Land Lot** – Instead of square feet, this option **automatically uses acres** as the unit of measurement.
* **Branding** – Designed for branding shoots, this option doesn’t require a unit of measurement since pricing is based on the [**Branding Booking flow**](booking-flows.md#general-settings).

For the **Description**, we recommend only one short sentence. It should be just enough to differentiate it from other Services without turning your booking process into a wall of text.

Under **Packaged Services**, you will select the Services (both Core and Add-On) that you included in this package. Click the box and start typing a name of a service, and the system will show you the options you can include.

### Additional Service Details

To enhance the presentation of your Packages, we support a number of Additional Service Details that are appropriate for one kind of Package or another. To learn more about this, please refer to this [section](additional-service-details.md).

### Pricing, Payout, Scheduling, and Twilight

Next, we need to tell the system how much to charge your customer, how much to pay your contractor, and how long to spend on site for Daytime and Twilight shoots.

### Custom Tier Pricing

This pricing method allows you to customize the pricing and create a unique name for every tier based on a specific square footage range. For example below, you can see different tier names and adjustments for every square footage.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Custom Tier package.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Custom Tier Sample (Package)</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Tier Price works differently for Custom Tiers. The Total Price for each tier is going to be the amount you enter PLUS the base price you entered at the top of the page.\
\
So in the above example, the total price for the first tier is $2,300, while the total price for the second tier is $2,400.\
\
Always click "Save" once editing is done.
{% endhint %}

### Payout

Enter the number you would like us to include in our reporting for [Broken link](broken-reference "mention").

### Scheduling

Enter the amount of time your photographer will require **onsite** and for Daylight hours only. This does not include travel or editing time.

### **Twilight Scheduling**

Enter the amount of time your photographer will require **onsite** and for Twilight hours only. So if the total package requires 3 hours and 2.5 hours of that are for the daylight components, enter 0.5 for the Twilight Scheduling.

## Double Check your Work

By now, you should have your first Package that includes at least a couple of Services. Repeat the above steps for each Package.\
\
We recommend doing a review to make sure your pricing and scheduling makes sense. For example, if a Package includes photos and video together that are typically $100 and 1 hour a piece as individual Services, make sure that the Package is around $200 and 2 hours. You may offer a price break of $175, for example, but you generally wouldn't want the Package to be _more_ expensive than the two services.
