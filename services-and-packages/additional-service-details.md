## Before/After Comparison

Before/After Comparison allows you to add two photos, and we'll insert a slider that Agents can use to flip between two photos for a side-by-side comparison. Before/After Comparison is recommended for retouching services or other digital alterations like virtual twilight or virtual staging.

Toggle the option on and then upload two images.

## Image Gallery

Image Gallery is a carousel rotation of additional images booking Agents can use to get more information about your service.

Toggle the option on and upload your images. If you make a mistake, there's a little trash can button to delete specific images.

## Detailed Description

Finally, if you just need a little more text to describe and market a service, you can insert a block of formattable text. Toggle the option on, and then you get several options to edit and format your text. The text you enter is "what you see is what you get." What you see in the editor is what you'll see on the marketing page.

Make sure to click **Save** at the bottom when you're done, and you can preview your new page by clicking the **Preview Popup** button.
