# Notifications

Every Service can be configured to notify specific _Staff_ or _Teams_ every time they are created. Under **General** > **Services** > go to the **Edit** tab for one of your Services.

Once there, scroll down and under **Notifications** you can enter in either a Staff member's name or a Team (like Video Editor). Click **Save** and you're all set. You may enter as many Staff members or Teams as you need.
