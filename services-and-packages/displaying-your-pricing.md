# Displaying your Pricing

Before you can add all of your services and packages, you need to make strategic decisions on how Tonomo will calculate and display your pricing. Is Tonomo going to be more of a self-check-out experience where Agents submit their projects and know what to expect on their invoices? Or more of a consultative experience where some information is discussed on a future call with a project manager?‌

This guide will walk you through the pricing strategies you will establish to ensure the best checkout experience for your customers.

## Dynamic Pricing <a href="#dynamic-pricing" id="dynamic-pricing"></a>

While Agents are booking, Tonomo displays the exact price they'll pay. We call this Dynamic Pricing. We can dynamically change the price the Agent will see based on the square footage of their project.‌

To set this up, you first need to configure your Square Footage Tiers, which tell Tonomo how you break down your pricing. For example, you sell Home Photos for $100 at 1,000 Sq Ft and $150 at 2,000 Sq Ft.

Square footage Tiers allow you to define different pricing for Services and how many hours to schedule per Service. You know your market best, so we let you granularly control how we calculate those pricing and scheduling breaks.‌

For example, once you've told Tonomo you want your Tiers at 1,000 and 2,000 Sq Ft, later you'll tell the system you want a drone tour to take 1 hour for 1,000 Sq Ft and 2 hours for 2,000 Sq Ft. This also instructs the system how to display [Dynamic Pricing](https://app.gitbook.com/@tonomo-writer/s/getting-started-with-tonomo/portal-setup/configure-general-booking#dynamic-pricing).‌

We provide a couple of Tiers already but feel free to edit those and, if you need more, click **+ Add Tier**. If you're coming to Tonomo with established Tiers you've used in the past, enter those and click **Save**. If you have never decided on square footage tiers for your business before, we can provide a rule of thumb. A typical breakdown is 4 or 5 Tiers at 1,000 Sq Ft increments for Residential or larger increments for Commercial. Start there, and you will soon get feedback from Agents if you have too few or too many. These tiers are easy to adjust in the future.
