# Custom Packages

Custom Packages allow you to offer unique rates and combinations of services for partnerships you've negotiated. If a brokerage has custom pricing for your Bronze, Silver, and Gold packages, for example, you can set those up in their own pricing page without impacting the packages you offer normally.

From there, enter all the information for the Custom Package and click **Save Changes** at the end. The **Agent Code** is what designates that Custom Package as part of a collection. So every Custom Package with the code "ACME" will be displayed together when an Agent goes to that Custom Package booking page.
