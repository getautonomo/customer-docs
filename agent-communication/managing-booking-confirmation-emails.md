# Managing Booking Confirmation Emails

The Tonomo system sends a copy of every booking email to the primary email on the account. This is intentional because it provides an "offline" copy of every movement of your business. Having redundancy for core functions is an important part of a healthy, growing business.\

If you feel your inbox is getting clogged up with emails, however, we recommend creating a filter to move those emails to it's own folder, skipping your inbox entirely.
