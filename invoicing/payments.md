# Payments

## Connect Square Account

The first step to collect payments in Tonomo is to connect your Square Seller Account. This can be done under **Configure Booking** > **Payments**. Click **Connect** and it will open in a new tab and ask for your username and password. Enter that and you're all done!\
\
No need to set up products, subscriptions, or anything like that. You may want to set up Locations if you operate in different markets and want to track the money coming in more easily that way.

## Accept Deposit on Booking

Simply check this box unless you know for certain you don't want to accept deposits from **any** customer in **any** location and of **any** type (i.e. commercial, residential, recurring customer)

## Allow Tips

Your customers may add a tip to their order that can then be tracked and applied to photographers. You have two options; by percentage or by amount.

"By Percentage" will be a % of the entire order amount, including Services, additional fees, credits, and taxes.

The amounts you enter into the fields to the right "Low tip", "Mid tip", and "High tip", present options to your customer they can easily select. However, they can always enter a custom amount. This works just like you'll see on some receipts from a restaurant.

## Referral Program

## Make manual payments as an Admin

If your customers paid using cash or another payment method, you can mark their orders on Tonomo by making manual payments on the order. \
\
Additionally, you can also remove payments that were already made by making negative payments. Since refunds are not processed through Tonomo, this will come in handy if you inadvertently charge the customer or if you are processing refunds.\


Here are the steps on how to make a manual payment:

1. &#x20;Go to **Orders Management** on the Portal
2. Select an order
3.  On the **Order Details**, click on **Sales**
