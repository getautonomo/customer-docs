To fully utilize our Invoicing features, you both need to have [Payment settings](https://docs.getautonomo.com/payments) for the account-wide level turned on as well as settings for each [Booking Flow](https://docs.getautonomo.com/services-and-packages/booking-flows#payment-settings).
{% endhint %}

Invoicing features per order can be found on the right-hand side of each order under the Order Details panel in Order Management.

By clicking **Payment details**, you can see a record of all previous successful and unsuccessful payment attempts. This can be helpful in troubleshooting why a payment failed.

When logged in, the customer’s credit card will be automatically stored in the system after a payment is made, allowing you to charge their invoice without needing to re-enter payment details.

You can also record a cash/check payment to unlock the files for the customer by clicking the "Cash" button. Also, the description can be changed.

You have the flexibility to enhance your invoice by incorporating three distinct items: **Coupons**, **Discounts**, **Fees, and Customized fees**.

* **Coupons:** Easily incorporate existing coupons or generate new ones tailored to your customers.
* **Discounts:** Provide flexibility with flat-rate or percentage-based discount options for your customers.
* **Fees:** Unlock the ability to create various fees—whether percentage-based, flat rates, or transaction fees. Additionally, you can establish specific fees like travel fees. Enhance clarity by adding a brief description for agents to understand each item thoroughly.
* **Custom Items**: Ability to create a specific fee that allows you to edit the title, quantity, amount, and description.
