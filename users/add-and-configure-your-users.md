# Add and Configure your Users

## User Setup

Each of your employees will have a user account that allows them to access the Tonomo system securely to manage their orders. At this time, Tonomo doesn't support mass invites to multiple users, so they will need to create their account one at a time, complete a little bit of setup on their end, and then you or another admin will need to assign them permissions. Get started by navigating to **User Management** on the left side of the screen.

But first, a word about the different types of Users we support.

### Who are Staff

Every email login on the portal is called a **User**, but you can promote some of your users to **Staff**. **Staff** are the photographers, PMs, and other employees who need to process orders. You can see **Staff** by clicking the **Staff** tab shown in the photo below.

From here, click on your Staff to manage their User settings.

Under **Permissions**, there are three options, **Staff**, **Admin**, and **Contractor**.

* **Staff:** The average employee. This person will have permission to process orders but not change booking configurations.
* **Admin:** The company leads or other admin assistants. This person has complete control over the portal and can add, change, or remove other users (including other Admins).
* **Contractor:** 3rd party users can only view orders and chat in those orders. They have no permissions to change any statuses or information on an order other than using the chat boxes.

**Last Used Booking Flow** is primarily for Agents, but what this does is change what Booking Flow the **Book a New Order** button sends you to.

### Who are Users

Your Staff aren't the only people who will be accessing the portal. Your customers will have their own User accounts as well!

At the time of booking, every Agent will have the option to create an account for themselves. This saves their branding and contact information to expedite the booking process.

They will also have access to a limited version of the portal to see previous orders and create new ones. Below is an example of an empty Agent login. We'll go into more detail about their portal in a later guide, but for now, it is enough to know that your Agents should create an account to take advantage of the portal.

### Adding your Staff

Now that you know who you should add to your Staff and the different options you have available to you, it's time to add each employee. You can do it on your own, but if you have your employees do it themselves, they will complete steps 1 and 2 on their own. Once they notify you they are done,  you will complete step 3, and then they will complete step 4. If you would like them to do steps 1, 2, and 4, send them this link: [https://docs.getautonomo.com/portal-setup/add-and-configure-your-users#adding-your-staff](https://docs.getautonomo.com/portal-setup/add-and-configure-your-users#adding-your-staff)

#### 1. Create the Staff Account

First, either log out of your portal or launch an Incognito version of your browser and go to your portal URL.  (Most likely portal.yourcompany.com)

Click the **Log In** button in the top right corner. If you are using Google is your company's email provider, you can click the **Sign in with Google** button.

Otherwise, click the blue **Register here** button. Enter the preferred email and password and then the blue **Sign up Now** button.

#### 2. Set up User Profile

Before the User appears in your portal, they must first set up their User Profile. After completing **Step 1**, they will be shown this screen.  They should enter their **Full Name** and **Cell Mobile Number.**

#### 3. **Set User to Staff**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are an employee reading this guide, you cannot do this step yourself. Notify your admin that you are ready for them to complete this step!
{% endhint %}

Now that the employee is a User in your portal, promote them to Staff so they can see and manage orders. Navigate back to **User Management** and click the **All** tab. Next click on one of your Users. You will set them to Staff under the Permission section.

Once done, the **Role** field will appear. Set their role in your company.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to set a person to be a Project Manager for an Order, they must be a **Project Manager** here under **Role**.
{% endhint %}

You can also hide the reporting pages, pricing, and sales information from staff members by navigating to the **General** section under **Configure Booking.** This helps maintain confidentiality and restricts access to sensitive data.

#### 4. Setup Calendar

All staff need to have their calendar connected to Tonomo so we can manage scheduling for them. For more information, please see this: [Connecting Photographer Accounts](../scheduling/calendar-integration.md#connecting-photographer-accounts)
