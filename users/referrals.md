Our referral system allows your customers to earn $ credit to be applied to their account when other customers book using their unique code. Those new customers will also receive the same $ credit that the referrer did.

To get started, you will need to enable the feature and set the $ amount you want your referrals and referralers to earn. Go to **Configure Booking > General**, **Enable** the **Referral program,** type the referral amount, and hit **Save**. You and your customers can find your Referral Code in one of two places.

Next, your customers will need to get their referral codes. It's located under the **Balance and Payments** tab of their user Profile, accessible by clicking their profile in the top left corner.

The customer has the option to do these things to their code:

1. **Share Code Option**

* The customer has the option to share the referral code.
* Alternatively, they can click "Copy Code."

2. **Copy Code Option**

* Clicking "Copy Code" generates a link for the new customer.
* The referral code is automatically applied when the new customer follows the link.

3. **Manual Entry Option:**

* If the customer prefers, they can manually enter the code during the booking process.
