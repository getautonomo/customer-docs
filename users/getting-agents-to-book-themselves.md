# Getting Agents to Book Themselves

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/n3ZyM0Ha8C8" %}

## Walkthrough Video

I recommend creating a walkthrough video of the portal. 60 seconds max. Send this in your email/texts.

* Don't even go through a full booking, just say "to see our pricing, enter your address, sq ft, and check out what we offer on the next page"
* Show them the dashboard, rescheduling themselves, canceling, and seeing historical assets

## Email to New Agents

Hey \{{name\}},\
\
I appreciate you giving my team the chance to solve your marketing problems. We've invested heavily into providing the best Agent experience in \{{our area\}}. That all starts with our [portal](https://linktoportal.com).

As a special welcome, here's $50 off the first time you book with code ONLINE.

After booking the first time, I'm going to create for you a referral code that you can share to earn $50 each time someone else uses it (they get the $50 too!). You can find that at the bottom of your [order dashboard](https://portal.yourdomain.com/order-dashboard) after booking.\
\
There are lots of other ways we make working with us easy, check out my quick [walkthrough](https://linktowalkthroughonyoutube.com).

I look forward to working with you,\

Hey \{{name\}},\
\
It's important that I use your time well and so I've invested in a portal that lets you book, reschedule appointments, and see past deliveries that you can access [here](../scheduling/scheduling-configuration/prevent-last-minute-bookings.md).

As a special bonus, the first time you book yourself here's $50 off with the code ONLINE.
