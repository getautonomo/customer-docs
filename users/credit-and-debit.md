# Credit and Debit

Photographers have the option to include a transaction credit or debit for particular clients, intended for future use. This provides an alternative to issuing refunds, offering referral credits, or implementing promotions. Conversely, if clients have outstanding credits awaiting application and their payment is still pending, you have the ability to debit their balance accordingly.



## Adding Credit or Debit to a Customerâ€™s Profile

To access this, navigate to the **Users Management > Users**. From there, choose the customer you wish to apply a credit/debit transaction to, proceed to their "**Balance and Payments**" tab, click on "**Add a transaction**," and opt for either **Credit** or **Debit**.

Step-by-step Instructions:

1. Head over to **User Management** and click the customer's name.
