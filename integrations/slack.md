# Slack

Our Slack notification integration will notify you when someone @your-name mentions you within the Chat in Tonomo. If this is the first time you've connected this app, you must have Admin credentials in Slack. Future users who connect it will be able to do so without Admin credentials.

To start, go to your profile in the top right corner and Staff settings. Click Connect Slack Account

Next, double check that you're connecting Tonomo to the correct community in the top right corner. Then click A**llow**.

Slack will process for a couple of seconds and then tell you that it successfully connected.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Next, test the integration by having someone **other than you** send you a message in an order's chat. **The integration ignores messages you send to yourself.**
{% endhint %}

Messages sometimes take a few seconds to arrive, but they will appear within the Apps section of Slack with the message and a link to that message so you can respond to it.
