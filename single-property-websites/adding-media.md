# Adding Media

## Videos

The easiest way to add video assets you've created for your agent is from Vimeo or Youtube.

The **Title** appears formatted above the video on the webpage. This allows you to brand the video differently than the title you'd put on Youtube if you prefer.

The **Status** lets your control if the video appears on the Branded, Unbranded, or Both versions of the site. You can also set it to **Hidden** if you want to hide the video without deleting it temporarily.

The **URL** is any normal URL you get from Youtube or Vimeo for a video like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdrgGf81EBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdrgGf81EBQ)

Alternatively, if you have a custom video player for your site that you've already invested it, it may generate some embed code that we can use to play the video.

Just click **Add** and then **Save** in the top right corner you'll be good to go!

If you're ready to publish, click **Publish** or **Republish** in the top right corner.
