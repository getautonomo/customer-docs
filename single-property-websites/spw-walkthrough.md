## Settings

### Theme

The property websites are fully customizable, offering a seamless way to add value to the exceptional service you already deliver. These changes will automatically apply to future websites created for that customer.

### Domains

In this section, you will be able to see all the lists of available domains that you have purchased through us. You can assign any of these domains to the property.

Within the "Admin panel" section, a dedicated "**Add custom domain**" button has been provided. By clicking this button, users can effortlessly add any desired domain for a listing, which is typically $14.99 per year. While we offer a suggestion based on the listing's address, you have the flexibility to modify this recommendation.

Alternatively, any domain purchased outside of tonomo can still be added as long as the DNS settings for the custom domain are set to the indicated record below.
