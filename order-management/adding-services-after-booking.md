This article will walk you through adding a Service to an order after the customer has already booked.

First, go to **Order Management** > **Orders** > and click the date or Order Name.

Then, on the Order Details panel that opens on the right, click the **+ Add Service** button. You will be given a list of Services and Packages that you can scroll through or search. Check the Service/Package you want to add and click **Add Services**.

On the confirmation page, indicate if we should update the invoice amount for the order. In addition, you can update the calendar event with the new Service. Finally, click **Confirm.**
