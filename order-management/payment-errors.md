# Payment Errors

During booking, if your customers are paying a deposit or full invoice before receiving their assets, they may receive an error from Square.

The errors the customer receives may be generic and not very helpful to them. However, you can pull some more information about what the error included on the backend.

Under Order Details, click **Payment Details**.

In this example, the user had typed "-$120.00" instead of "$120.00".

These errors are generated by Square, not us. However, the error may not be this clear and so you may need to do a quick google to learn more from Square. If you have any questions, reach out to Tonomo support.
