# Cancelling Orders

You may cancel orders either via the Order Management panel or the Order Details panel of each order.

When you set the Order Status to **Cancelled** we'll cancel the order and provide a pop-up asking if you want us to delete the calendar event associated with the order. Indicate **OK** to cancel the event or **Cancel** to not cancel the event.

If you cancel the event, the user will receive a notification from their calendar provider letting them know the event was canceled.

{% hint style="info" %}
If in the future you need to recreate the calendar event, see our article on [that](../scheduling/changing-scheduling-details/create-calendar-event-after-postponing-or-cancelling.md).
{% endhint %}
