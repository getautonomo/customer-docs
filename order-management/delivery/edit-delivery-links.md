# Edit Delivery Links

After Syncing Delivery Files for the first time, you can then edit what assets you are delivering to your customers. Perhaps as a one-off you want to remove the folder for 2D Layout or add a link for an additional Service you completed that you don't have in Tonomo.

To complete this, click **Edit links** after Syncing the Delivery Files at least once.
