# Customize Order Management View

**How to customize your order management page to view important details at a glance**\
Being able to view thumbnails, deliverables links and other important details at a glance, can help you quickly manage orders. \
To personalize your order management page:

Click the "+" icon on the right side to open the customization menu.

Select the items you want to display and deselect those you donâ€™t need.

A popular option is the cover feature, which displays a thumbnail of synced photos on the order, making it easier to recall property addresses.\
