# Set a Service as an Escalation

You can mark a service as an escalation, which will display a red bar on the left side of the order and change the service color to red. This helps highlight important orders or services, making them more noticeable and easier to identify.



Quick Steps to Set a Service as Escalation:

1. **Go to Order Management** and select the order.
2. **Click on Project Chat**.
3. **Select the Service** you want to escalate.
4. **Click the Three Dots** and choose "Edit."
5. **Toggle On “Set as Escalation”** and click "Save."

The order will now be marked as RED in the dashboard.\
