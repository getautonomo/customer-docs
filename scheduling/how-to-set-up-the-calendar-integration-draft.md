# How to Set Up the Calendar Integration (Draft)

Tonomo offers a seamless calendar integration suite that consolidates your bookings, event details, and photographer availability in one place. By setting up this integration, you unlock features like Integrated Booking, which allows agents to book services directly through the booking flow. We will walk you through connecting Tonomo to your primary calendar.

At this time, Tonomo integrates exclusively with Google Calendar. If you use another calendar provider or need assistance, please contact the **Tonomo Customer Support Team** via your private Slack channel or reach out to your **Tonomo Onboarder**.

## **Benefits of the New Integration**

The new calendar system offers several key advantages over the previous integration:

* **Increased Efficiency**: The new setup is streamlined, reducing the likelihood of scheduling errors.
* **Support for Multiple Calendars**: Photographers can now connect multiple calendars for greater flexibility in managing availability.
* **Simplified Setup**: Tonomo only needs to connect to the main calendar. Once photographers share their calendars with the primary account, Tonomo can seamlessly integrate them.

## **How to Upgrade from the Old Calendar Integration**

Upgrading to the new calendar integration is quick and can be done via Slack. Follow these steps:

1.  **Reconnect the Main Calendar**\
    Go to **Org Settings** > **Team**, then reconnect your main calendar.\

   Ping the **Tonomo Customer Support Team** and ask them to enable the **New Calendar Integration** for scheduling.
3. **Update Your Calendar**
   * Navigate to **Configure Booking** > **Scheduling**.
   *   Locate your profile and click the pencil icon under the **Calendar Name** column.\

4. **Inform the Support Team**\
   Let the **Tonomo customer support team** know you’ve completed the setup.

## **Connecting Your Primary Calendar**

When you integrate your main calendar with Tonomo, that calendar will "own" all events created within the system. The connected account will be able to edit or delete calendar events directly.

**Recommendation**: Use a generic email account (e.g., info@yourcompany.com or booking@yourcompany.com) to avoid issues if the account holder loses access, or if an emergency requires changes to events.

**To connect your primary calendar:**

1. Go to **Org Settings** > **Team**.
2. Follow the prompts to link your account.

**Important Notes:**

* If you’re using a generic email account (e.g., info@yourcompany.com), use that for the integration. If not, choose a senior staff member’s account who will likely stay with the company long-term.
* **Less Secure Apps Warning**: If you see a warning about connecting a "Less Secure App" from Google, follow the steps in your Google Admin Console to resolve it.

## **Connecting Photographer Accounts**

With our upgraded integration, adding photographers to Tonomo is quick and easy. An Admin must set up a photographer profile for each member in order to view availability and manage events for your team.

**Step 1: Share Google Calendar with Primary Account**

Each photographer needs to share their Google calendar(s) with the primary calendar connected to Tonomo. They must grant "Make changes to events" permission to allow Tonomo to view event details and calculate travel time.

For instructions on sharing calendars and understanding permission levels, refer to the [Google Calendar documentation](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082?hl=en\&authuser=2#zippy=%2Cunderstand-permission-settings-for-shared-calendars).\

**Step 2: Set Up Photographer Profile**

Once the photographer shares their calendar, you can set up their profile:

1. Go to **Configure Booking > Scheduling** and click on **"Setup new photographer."**
2. Enter the photographer’s name or email in the **User Name or Email** field (only Admin, Staff, and Contractor users will appear).
3. Choose the photographer's primary calendar from the dropdown. If their calendar isn’t listed, it means they haven’t shared it yet—refer to Step 1.
4. If needed, link additional calendars to track availability.
