{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/2464a6dacd094fbea7dff7ab0aca5e4c?sid=2e8035b0-669f-4393-ae85-00e65cce3553" %}

Using Tonomo, you can easily manage travel time. When your customers request an appointment, Tonomo will recommend timeslots with photographers who already have nearby appointments. This helps reduce the amount of travel time your photographers spend between photoshoots. Using recommended time slots will also waive travel fees for locations that would normally have them.

Here are the steps to enable this feature:

1. Go to **Configure Booking > Booking Flow**.&#x20;
2. Click **Edit** on the **Booking Flow** you want to set up the Smart Scheduling.
3. Enable Integrated Booking
4. Set the value for the following:
   * _**Nearby distance limit**_ - Set your preferred radius and the system will consider your current photo shoot distance when scheduling the next client.
   * _**Nearby travel time**_ - Travel time will differ depending on the location. Adding travel time will prevent you from exceeding the preferred travel time.
