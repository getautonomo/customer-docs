# Prevent Last Minute Bookings

By default, the Tonomo system will display your team as available even if they want a booking 30 minutes from the time of booking. If you would like the system to prevent bookings by few hours or even a couple days, go to **Configure Booking** > **Scheduling** > and enter a value within **Prevent last minute bookings**.

Make sure to click **Save Changes**.
