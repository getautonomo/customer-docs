# Integrated Booking

## What is Integrated Booking?

Integrated Booking is the ability for your customers to schedule their project themselves on your team's calendar. When they are booking, they'll see all of your availability that meet the criteria of the project.

When the Agent selects a time and completes a booking, we create a calendar event on your [primary calendar](https://docs.getautonomo.com/scheduling/calendar-integration) and then share that event to the booking Agent and the photographer we assigned based on your criteria. You will be able to modify the schedule by changing what photographers are assigned or the shoot date/time, but this gives the scheduling a starting place.

We will show availability based on the length of the shoot which you have set in your Services and Packages. So if an Agent requests photos and video at 1 hour a piece, we will only show time slots where your staff have 2 hours of availability. We will also ensure there is 30 minutes of availability before and after the shoot for drive time.

## Integrated Booking Setup

Integrated booking requires four pre-requisites that are mandatory.

1. Turn Integrated Booking on. This is done under **Configure Booking** > **General** and then **Enable Integrated Booking** and **Save**.
2. [Connect a primary calendar account](https://docs.getautonomo.com/scheduling/calendar-integration#connecting-a-primary-account).
3. Connect the [calendar accounts of every person](https://docs.getautonomo.com/scheduling/calendar-integration#connecting-a-primary-account) who will be going on-site for shoots.
4. Ensure that your scheduling hours are set properly for every [Service ](https://welcome.getautonomo.com/portal-setup/services#scheduling)and [Package](https://welcome.getautonomo.com/portal-setup/packages#pricing-and-scheduling).

These are the 4 mandatory requirements for using Integrated Booking, but there are a few other ways we modify your photographers availability.

* The [photographer's availability](https://docs.getautonomo.com/scheduling/photographer-availability) in their calendar
* [Service Zones](https://docs.getautonomo.com/scheduling/service-zones) so that photographers can only be booked in specific areas
* [Skillsets ](https://docs.getautonomo.com/scheduling/staff-skillsets)so that we don't send someone who hasn't been trained in videography to a video shoot
* [Prevent Last Minute Bookings](https://docs.getautonomo.com/scheduling/prevent-last-minute-bookings) so Agents can't book with only 30 minutes notice
* [Send 2 Photographers](https://docs.getautonomo.com/scheduling/send-2-photographers) so that long shoots can be done more quickly
