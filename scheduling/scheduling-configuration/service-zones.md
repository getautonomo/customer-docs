Service Zones are geographical areas where you photographers will only be assigned bookings that are within that area. For example, if you have a photographer on the south side of town, you may set their Service Zone for the south so that they aren't driving an hour + to a shoot. This can reduce inefficiencies and costs in your system as long as you have the photographers in each area to support the volume you're receiving.

First, to get to Service Areas, click **Configure Booking** > **Scheduling** > **Service Areas** > click **Enable Service Areas**.

Then, you'll see a list of your photographers. Those without a Service Area will have "(not set)" after their name. If you have Service Areas turned on, then by default photographers will be able to service all geographical areas.

To see a photographer's Service Area, check or uncheck the boxes on the left and the Service Area highlighted in red on the map is the one that you are editing. The others will be in black.

To create a Service area, click on the map and it will start drawing a line (don't hold the mouse button. Click and release). Move your mouse and click where you would like the next boundary. Continue until you've completed your bounds. To delete your service area, simply click the delete key on your keyboard.

Make sure to click **Save Changes** at the bottom!
