# Photographers Priority

You can configure Tonomo to use priority-based scheduling instead of round-robin. Tonomo will assign events to the highest-priority photographer unless they are unavailable at the scheduled time.

To enable this, go to **Configure Booking > Scheduling**, and toggle on enable photographers priority under the **Photographers Priority** tab.
