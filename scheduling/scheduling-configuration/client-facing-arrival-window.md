# Client-Facing Arrival Window

How to Set Up Client-Facing Arrival Window Display

Overview

Instead of showing exact start and end times, you can now display an arrival window to customers. This feature provides flexibility by indicating that the photographer may arrive at any point within the specified time range, rather than guaranteeing an exact arrival time.

Steps to Configure Arrival Windows

1. Go to Configure Booking > Scheduling.
2. Locate the "Arrival Window" settings section.
3. Enable the arrival window display by toggling the feature on.
4. Set your desired time buffer (e.g., 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.).
5. This expands the original appointment slot into a range (e.g., "1:00 PM - 1:30 PM" instead of "1:00 PM").
6. Save changes to apply the new settings.

Recommended Additional Settings

To prevent confusion, we suggest:

1. Disabling calendar invitations (if enabled) to avoid conflicting exact-time reminders.
2. Go to Configure Booking > Notifications and turn off "Send Calendar Invites."

How It Appears to Customers

Instead of seeing an exact time (e.g., 1:00 PM), customers will see a window (e.g., Between 1:00 PM - 1:30 PM).
