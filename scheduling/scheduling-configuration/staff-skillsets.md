Not every one of your staff members may yet be trained on all of the Services you offer so you can set Tonomo to prevent booking those photographers on projects they lack skills in.

To turn this on, click **Configure Booking** > **Scheduling** > **Enable**.&#x20;

Across the rows are the Services in the Tonomo portal organized under their categories.

A checked box means that Tonomo _will_ book that photographer for that Service (assuming all of the other criteria like availability match). An unchecked box means that Tonomo _will not_ book that photographer for that Service, _regardless_ of whether they are available or not.\
