# Calendar/Tonomo Mismatch

If you have a calendar event with description details or invites that don't match the Tonomo portal, we need to see where that mismatch occured.\
\
Google offers an audit tool to see every action taken on every calendar event in your Google account. You must log in as an admin.

Then,

{% hint style="info" %}
Click this link directly to the [Audit ](https://admin.google.com/ac/reporting/audit/calendar?new=true)section within Google and skip to number 4 below. If that link doesn't work for you, proceed with step 1.
{% endhint %}

1. In your Google **Admin console** (at admin.google.com)
2. Go to [Reports](https://admin.google.com/ac/reporting/home).
3. On the left, click **Audit**![and then](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/Th2Tx0uwPMOhsMPn7nRXMUo3vs6J0pto2DTn)**Calendar**.\

5. Click **Event Title** and it will pop up a search field. Select Contains.
6. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (160).png>)

Enter in just part of the subject line for the calendar event in question like the street address and click **Apply.**

7\. Click **Search** below the Event Title field. If you get no results, try removing digits from the search. So search "1234 Main" instead of "1234 Main St"

8\. Once you have search results with just the event in question, click **Export All**. This will generate a Google Sheets. Share this with your Tonomo support person at their email which they will provide.
