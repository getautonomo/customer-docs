# Calendar Integration

## Connecting a Primary Account

Tonomo has a calendar integration suite built-in so that you can manage your bookings, event details, and view the photographer's availability. Setting up the calendar integration also enables other cool features like Integrated Booking so that your agents can book their service directly from the booking flow. We will configure this later if needed. But for now, let's get Tonomo talking with your calendar.

{% hint style="info" %}
Our calendar can integrate with all major calendar providers like Google, Exchange, Office, and many more. If you have any concerns about if your calendar provider is covered, reach out to your Tonomo Onboarder!
{% endhint %}

When you integrate a calendar with Tonomo, that calendar will "own" all of the events Tonomo creates. It's going to be the account that can edit or delete calendar events in your calendar provider. We recommend that the account you choose is generic and not tied to a specific person.

For example, if you have an info@yourcompany.com, booking@yourcompany.com, or another similar calendar, we recommend using that. It is not mandatory, but using a specific person's calendar poses some challenges. First, if you lost access to the account, that can cause interruption of your scheduling services until it is changed. Second, if someone other than the account holder needs to get into the account to make changes to events due to an emergency, they may have more access to the account than the calendar.

Whichever account you're going to use, enter that email under **Connect primary calendar account** and click **Save.**

If you have a generic email account like info@yourcompany.com, use that. If you do not, use a senior person's account, choose someone that will be with the company for a while.

### Less Secure Apps

When connecting an account for the first time, you may receive a warning that you are attempting to connect a "Less Secure App" from Google. This can be circumvented by allowing these types of apps in your [admin console.](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)

## Connecting User Accounts

If you want to be able to view availability and manage the events of your Staff, they will also need to connect their own Calendars within _their_ user portal. First, they go to their **Profile** in the top left corner, click the **Staff Settings** tab, and click **Connect Calendar Account**.

The following steps will be for connecting a Google calendar, but any other calendar provider should be similar. If you're having any trouble, please let us know!
