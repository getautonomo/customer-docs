# Embed Booking Flow

Linking the portal to your website's "Book Now" button is a common practice, but you can also embed the portal directly into your website. To do this, navigate to **Configure Booking > General**, where you'll find the Booking Embed Link. You can use this link to seamlessly integrate the booking flow into your website.

Here's an example from one of our clients, Hill Property Media, showcasing the embedded booking flow on their [website](https://www.hillpropertymedia.com/).
