# Twilight Shoots

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/1255fecf531f4d2aadffb2f4a02f27ca?sid=9d202a8a-297e-42b3-aeb8-ed67140e81c7" %}

Some Services need to be completed at a different time of day than the bulk of services ordered. For example, a Twilight Shoot needs to be completed at 6pm while everything else was shot at 11am.

You can configure the system to require your customers to book two appointments at the time of booking so that you and your customer get the correct scheduling information for every order.

## Set Service to Twilight Service

1. First, you must configure which hours you consider as "Twilight Hours". This is something you can change at-will as the seasons change. Go to **Configure Booking** > **General** and under **Scheduling**, set the Start and End times for Twilight Hours and click **Save**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The first set of availability hours should be when you normally take **daytime** appointments. However, if you toggle on **don't split appointments** we allow customers to book daytime events **after** these hours in the cases where they're also booking a Twilight appointment.\
\
For example, if your daytime hours usually end at 6:00pm and Twilight begins at 7:00pm, we'll allow customers to book the daytime portion of their shoot at 6:30pm so that it can lead directly into 7:00pm for the twilight shoot.

3. To test, click **Book a New Order** and then **Refresh** **the page**.
4. Book an order like normal, ensuring you select the Service you set to **Twilight Service** and one other Service that **is not** Twilight Service.
5.  On the Scheduling Page you should be prompted to enter two appointments, one for the Service(s) you selected that are not **Twilight Services**, and one for the Service(s) you selected that are **Twilight Services**.
