# Change Calendar Description After Booking

{% hint style="warning" %}
This article is for if you are using our [Integrated Booking](../scheduling-configuration/integrated-booking.md#integrated-booking-setup).
{% endhint %}

1\) Click on your Order in **Order Management** to open the Order Details panel on the right. Click **Open in Scheduler**. (Don't see that button? You may have created this order before turning on Integrated Booking. Try creating a new order.)

There are two methods for updating the calendar template:

First, we can do it for you by clicking the **Reload from Template** and then the **Update Calendar Event** buttons. This will pull any changes to the scheduling, services, or other information we're pulling via [variables](../../agent-communication/variables.md).

But if you manually want to update the event details to overwrite the template, simply click into the editing field and make your changes. Finally, click **Update Calendar Event.**
