# Accessing and Editing Order Details in the Scheduler

You can view and edit order details directly from the scheduler for quick access. To see an order's details:

* Navigate to the scheduler.
* Click on any order, the details will appear on the right side of the screen.

From here, you can review or modify any order information such as customer, see what booking flow the order was placed on, client preferences, customer notes, location, apartment/floor, total interior area, entry notes, feature notes, add or remove services, custom questions, brokerage preferences and add new appointments to the order.\

**Photographer Services Filter in Scheduler**&#x20;

You can find a Photographer Services section to the left panel of the scheduler! This helps you quickly find photographers based on the services needed for a specific order.  Each  service will feature a toggle, enable toggles to highlight only photographers who perform the selected services.

How It Works:

* Default View: All photographer columns are active (white).
* Toggle On:
  * Photographers who perform the selected service(s) stay active.
  * Others are de-emphasized (gray).
* Toggle Off: Reverts to the default view.
