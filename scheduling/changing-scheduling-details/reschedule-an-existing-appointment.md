# Reschedule an Existing Appointment

If you need to change the date or time of a scheduled shoot, you can complete this in the **Scheduler**, accessible under **Order Details** of an order.

From there, you can change the time of the order by clicking and dragging the event, just like you would in Google Calendar.

If you need to change the date, time, or length of the event, point your cursor to the event and click the pencil icon that shows up.

After clicking the pencil icon, this will pop up. You can now change the date, time, or length of the event. You will also have the option to add or remove photographers and guests. Don't forget to hit "Save event" when you are done.
