# Change Photographers after Booking

Lots can change after a booking has been made, so we support changing which photographers are assigned to an order.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This article is for if you are using our [Integrated Booking](../scheduling-configuration/integrated-booking.md#integrated-booking-setup).
{% endhint %}

1\) Click on your Order in **Order Management** to open the Order Details panel on the right. Click **Open in Scheduler**. (Don't see that button? You may have created this order before turning on Integrated Booking. Try creating a new order.)

2\) To edit, simply point your cursor to the event and click the pencil icon that shows up.

3\) Either click the existing photographer's name to remove the assigned photographer and replace him with another person, or click **Add Photographer** to send two or more photographers to the event. Then click **Save Event.**
